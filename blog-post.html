                        <h4>september 3, 2020</h4>
                        <p>La French Cafe is located in New York City, Manhattan. This equisite restaurant is one of a kind.  A French Bistro infusioning with French and Thai ingredients is a delight to witness and taste. I came here on a Tuesday evening. Considering it was a weeknight the wait time was an hour. I wouldn’t want to know what it would be on a Friday nor a Saturday evening.</p>
                        <p>Once I arrived the Maitre D greeted me and took my coat for the coat check. He was very friendly and professional. I got seated by a window which overlooked central park, an absolutely beautfiul view. After reviewing the menu there was a seasonal dish that I wanted to check out. The server arrived promptly and took my order.</p>
                        <p>I am a scotch drinker so I ordered the Glenlevit 18 on the rocks. I ordered the bacon wrap triscuit which was phenominal. The ambience is very cool and swag. I can tell this is a popular local spot for wallstreet executives. My caesar salad and tomatoe bisque soup arrived later on. The caesar salad was refreshing and the soup was very flavorful with a hint of spice to it. Then my main course which was the Cognac Shrimp with Beurre Blanc Pasta was delicious.</p>
                        <p>Overall the establishment was a great experience. I definitely recommend it if you have the money to do so. This is considered a five star restaurant so save that money, unless you are just filthy rich.</p>
